# AWS Startup 101: Setting Up Your AWS Accounts (The Easy Way)

Setting up your AWS accounts *right* from the start can save you a ton of headaches later. There are multiple ways to do it, but the default setup often misses a few things that'll make life easier for your team.

**Tip:** If you're using IAM users or have credential files, this guide is *definitely* for you.

The ideal setup involves multiple AWS accounts grouped under a single AWS Organization, with your team authenticating through Single Sign-On (SSO) to access the AWS Console and the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI).

Sounds complex? It's a one-time process, and after this you won't have to think about it much again. Let's get started!

## 1. Create a Management Account

The first step is creating the management account.  This is the central hub for your AWS Organization.

*   **Use a work email alias.** Create an alias like `aws@yourcompany.com` that forwards to your real email. This allows you to delegate access to others in the future without sharing your personal email.
*   **Name the account after your company.** For example, `YourCompanyName`. This helps with identification.
*   **Enter your billing information and confirm your identity.** Pretty standard stuff.
*   **Choose basic support.** You can always upgrade later if needed.

Once you're done, you should be able to log in and access the AWS Console.

**Important:** The credentials for this account are *extremely* powerful.  You should rarely need them again. Seriously, consider throwing away (or securely storing) the password after completing this guide. You can always reset it if absolutely necessary.

**What to Do:**

*   ✅ Use a work email alias for long-term management.
*   ✅ Choose a clear and descriptive account name.
*   ✅ Securely store the root account credentials (or, even better, reset the password to something long and complex and store it securely).

**What NOT to Do:**

*   ❌ Use your personal email address.
*   ❌ Use a generic or unclear account name.
*   ❌ Use these credentials for everyday tasks!

## 2. Setting Up Your AWS Organization (The Family Plan)

Now, create your AWS Organization. This lets you manage all your accounts under one umbrella.

*   Log in to the AWS Management Console using the *management account* credentials.
*   Search for **AWS Organizations** and click on the result.
*   Follow the prompts to **Create an Organization**.

**Key things to remember:**

*   Enable all features when setting up the Organization (this gives you the most flexibility).
*   Verify your email address when prompted.
*   AWS Organizations is free. You only pay for the resources used within the individual accounts.

**What to Do:**

*   ✅ Enable all features in your AWS Organization.
*   ✅ Verify your email address to activate the Organization.

**What NOT to Do:**

*   ❌ Skimp on enabling all features; it limits your management capabilities.

## 3. Create Separate Accounts for Dev, Staging, and Production (The Golden Rule)

This is where things get smart. Create dedicated accounts for each environment: Development, Staging, and Production.

**Why?  Because chaos is bad.  And accidents happen.**

*   **Security:** One compromised account doesn't bring down your entire operation.
*   **Stability:** No accidental "rm -rf /" commands in production (we've all been there, right?).
*   **Cost Tracking:**  See exactly where your money is going for each environment.
*   **Resource Limits:** Avoid hitting AWS resource limits by spreading things out.

**How to Create the Accounts:**

*   Within the AWS Organizations console, click **Add an AWS Account** and choose **Create an AWS account**.
*   For each new account, you'll need:
    *   A unique email address (you can use aliases of your main work email, like `aws-dev@yourcompany.com`).
    *   A unique account name (`YourCompanyName-Dev`, `YourCompanyName-Staging`, `YourCompanyName-Prod`).

**What to Do:**

*   ✅ Create separate accounts for each environment (Dev, Staging, Prod).
*   ✅ Use a consistent and clear naming convention for all accounts.

**What NOT to Do:**

*   ❌ Put everything in one account (resist the urge!).

## 4. Enforce MFA Across the Organization (The Security Blanket)

Protect your accounts by requiring MFA for *all* users. AWS Organizations makes this easy to enforce.

*   Within the AWS Organizations console, navigate to **Service Control Policies (SCPs)**.
*   Create a new SCP that enforces MFA. (You can find example SCPs online – search for "AWS Organizations enforce MFA SCP" ).
*   Apply this SCP to your entire Organization.

**What to Do:**

*   ✅ Create and apply an SCP to enforce MFA across all accounts.
*   ✅ Educate your team about the importance of MFA and how to set it up.

**What NOT to Do:**

*   ❌ Assume everyone will enable MFA on their own – enforce it!

## 5. Setting Up SSO Access (The Easy Way In)

Now for the magic: Single Sign-On (SSO). SSO lets your team access all your AWS accounts with a single set of credentials.

*   Within the AWS Organizations console (still logged in as the management account), go to AWS IAM Identity Center.
*   Enable AWS IAM Identity Center.
*   Connect your identity provider. AWS IAM Identity Center supports popular providers like Okta, Azure AD, and Google Workspace.  Alternatively, you can use AWS IAM Identity Center's built-in identity store.
*   Create users and groups within AWS IAM Identity Center (or sync them from your identity provider).
*   Assign users and groups to your AWS accounts and define the permissions they have (e.g., "AdministratorAccess" for admins, "ReadOnlyAccess" for auditors).

**What to Do:**

*   ✅ Enable AWS IAM Identity Center in your AWS Organization.
*   ✅ Connect your existing identity provider (if you have one).
*   ✅ Assign users and groups to your AWS accounts with appropriate permissions.

**What NOT to Do:**

*   ❌ Create individual IAM users within each AWS account (use AWS IAM Identity Center for centralized management).

## 6. Billing and Cost Management (The Bottom Line)

Centralized billing with AWS Organizations lets you see all your costs in one place.

*   Enable consolidated billing in the AWS Organizations console.
*   Use AWS Cost Explorer to analyze your spending across all accounts.
*   Set up AWS Budgets and CloudWatch alarms (as described earlier) to track your costs and prevent surprises.

**What to Do:**

*   ✅ Enable consolidated billing in your AWS Organization.
*   ✅ Use AWS Cost Explorer to analyze spending patterns.
*   ✅ Set up AWS Budgets and CloudWatch alarms for cost control.

**What NOT to Do:**

*   ❌ Ignore the centralized billing features – it's essential for cost management.

## 7. The Management Account: Put it Away!

That management account? Lock it down! Now that everything is set up with AWS Organizations and SSO access, you rarely, if ever, need to log in to it again.

*   Change the root account password to something long, complex, and virtually unguessable.
*   Store the password securely (password manager, encrypted file, etc.).
*   Document the process for accessing the management account in case of emergencies.

**What to Do:**

*   ✅ Store the root account credentials securely, in case you lose access to AWS IAM Identity Center or SSO breaks for some reason.

**What NOT to Do:**

*   ❌ Use the management account for any everyday tasks. It's for emergencies only!

## Conclusion: AWS Account Setup - Nailed It!

You've now set up a secure, scalable, and well-organized AWS environment for your startup.  By following these steps, you've avoided common pitfalls and created a foundation for long-term success.

Now go build something amazing!
